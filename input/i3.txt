Meeting with Towa-sama peko. That was not a singing video peko. I met Towa-sama at that concert, the anniversary concert of Towa-sama, I heard "Unravel" there, there is no one who wouldn't become a fan after hearing that peko. She is too cool, isn't she peko? From there, I started watching the singing sessions peko. Of course, I don't check every song peko. Not at all peko. But I've seen the ones I'm interested in, and she is cool peko! I think peko. The feminine part of me just can't help it peko. It's there, isn't it peko? I don't buy all the merchandise or anything peko. But I do have tapestries and acrylics stands peko. I don't call them merchandise, but, well, that's it, isn't it peko? They are like clothes peko. It is natural to have them peko. For me, that is peko. A fan is still a fan even if they doesn't buy any merchandise peko. Merchandise is not everything peko. Of course, I think it's great that people but it peko. I would appreciate it if my fans buy merchandise peko. But it doesn't matter, everyone has his or her way of guessing peko. I don't impose "This is how fans should be peko!". I don't force my fans to be this way peko. You are free to do whatever you want peko. It doesn't matter at all peko. It doesn't mean that I'm great because I check all of the distribution peko. The form of love is different for each person peko. It's not like, "This is the way it should be peko!". It's not like you have to watch them in real time peko. I think it's weird to impose an idea that you have to watch it in real time peko. I'm not saying it's bad to watch in real time peko. I'm saying it's not good to force it on people peko. I PEKO... like peko... I like Towa-sama peko? Yes, I do peko.
